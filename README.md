Point of Sale system in java
During my masters' program at the University we were tasked to build a Point of Sale system in Java which is important because in today’s businesses, technology is highly recommended for many business sectors, from small to medium. The POS System gathers all the important data from sales, inventory, and customers. As a result, the data and information processed by the POS System can be useful for calculations and marketing campaigns that encourage customers to visit your store while keeping your bottom line in check. 
The Point of Sale System works simply by logging in with the registered username and password. This Point of Sale System works more on processing sales and payment transactions at the point of purchase. The user of the system can perform CRUD operations, or create, read, update, and delete products and customers in the system. And what’s more, the system can monitor the most purchased product and track sales from previous months, days, or even weeks, which is very essential to a business.
The Point of Sale System or POS System is built fully in Java and MySQL Database. It has full-featured Graphical User Interface (GUI) with all the functionalities required by the Stores to improved their customer satisfaction.
